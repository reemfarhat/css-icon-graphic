        <p>October 7, 2021 </p>

        <p>Officials announced support plans for New York City residents still recovering from Hurricane Ida at the federal, state and local levels at a virtual town hall earlier this afternoon. Among these announcements were solutions to food insecurity and assurances that undocumented immigrants would be able to recive assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>

        <p>New York City Councilmember Mark Levine announced solutions for residents facing food insecurity, which he said had been exacerbated by Hurricane Ida. He discussed the city’s food delivery services and urged citizens to visit the city’s disaster relief website for more resources. </p>

        <p>Carlotta Chang Appleton, a manager at the disaster recovery center at FEMA, announced that a​​ssistance is not only limited to US citizens and non-residents who have minor resident children can also apply. The announcement is an assurance to many New Yorkers because the city is home to over 476,000 undocumented immigrants, according to the 2020 the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs annual report.</p>

        <p>Appleton declined to answer a question about a specific timeline on when applicants can expect to receive assistance, citing the influx of requests due to Hurricane Ida. </p>

        <p>“The caseloads are a lot right now,” she said. “To actually put a number of days to the timeline, I wouldn't want to do that, but it shouldn't be a long process.”</p>

        <p>During the Facebook live event, the officials directed New Yorkers to various resources. The entire Facebook live event can be viewed on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network’s page. Appleton directed users to FEMA’s designated disaster zone in order to see if their zone is included. As of the publication of this article, 19 counties in New York are included. City officials also shared a post storm resource list and a contact list. The resource list includes all types of aid New Yorkers can apply for to receive post hurricane assistance. The contact list includes financial and housing contacts as well as flood relief and hurricane service centers. </p>

        <p>The aforementioned resources are linked below.</p>

        <p>Appleton also shared that in instances where an applicant is a home or business owner, they could be referred to the Small Business Loan Administration. Officials at the town hall stressed that contrary to popular belief, loans from the SBA are not just limited to business owners.</p>

        <p>Carl Dombek, the Public Affairs Specialist at the Small Business Loan administration told attendees that anyone with damage from the storm can register, but to be sure to register for assistance from FEMA first.</p>

        <p>Although the town hall was hosted on Facebook live by Representative Adriano Espaillat, Espaillat left the meeting midway through the town hall to vote in the House of Representatives. Levine took over moderating the forum, where attendees participated by writing comments for the officials. </p>

        <p>Multiple attendees expressed feelings of frustration due to difficulties getting the help they need from federal and local organizations.</p>

        <p>Levine assured attendees that they had support from all levels of government. </p>

        <p>“Good news for New Yorkers who are struggling to get back from Ida,” Levine said. “You have support from the federal level, you have support from the city government, you have support from FEMA the Federal Emergency Management Association, and you have support from the Small Business Administration.”</p>
